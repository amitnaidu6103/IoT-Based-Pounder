# IoT-Based-Pounder

The IoT-Based Pounder is a lever-based model designed for the purpose of pounding or crushing various materials.

The prototype incorporates a mechanical mechanism featuring two buckets attached to either end of a lever, along with a pounder. Initially, one of the buckets is filled with water, causing the lever to tip in that direction. An accelerometer integrated into the prototype triggers the bucket filled with water to begin transferring its contents to the empty bucket as the lever continues to oscillate. Sensors within the prototype continually monitor the position of the lever and control the water pump to facilitate its up-and-down motion.

This cyclic process is maintained to ensure a consistent water level differential between the buckets on the lever. Each bucket is equipped with hammers, which, upon being filled with water, are released under the force of gravity, effectively crushing the material beneath them.

The IoT-Based Pounder model, incorporating a lever mechanism and IoT technology, significantly reduces the need for human intervention and operates with minimal energy consumption, making it highly energy-efficient.

Advantage:

The IoT based pounding machines can crush things in a very effective way, thanks to their advanced technology. By leveraging sensors and analytics, the machines can optimise the crushing process, delivering consistent and high-quality results. This efficiency can help to save time, money, and resources, making it a valuable investment for various industries.

The IoT technology used in the machine allows for remote control from anywhere in the world, making it a convenient and user-friendly option. This feature enables users to monitor and control the pounding process from their fingertips, ensuring that the process is running smoothly and without interruption.

The energy efficiency of the IoT-based pounding machines is significantly higher than traditional pounding machines. This higher efficiency means that the machines consume less energy, resulting in a lower cost of operation. This cost-effectiveness can help to save money in the long run, making it an attractive option for businesses and individuals alike.

The IoT-based pounding machines can be customised to meet specific needs and requirements. With advanced analytics and sensors, the machines can be adjusted to optimise performance and efficiency for specific applications. This customization can help to improve the quality and consistency of the pounding process, resulting in better overall outcomes.
