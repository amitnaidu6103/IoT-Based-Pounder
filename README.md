The IoT-Based Pounder is a lever-based model designed for the purpose of pounding or crushing various materials.

The prototype incorporates a mechanical mechanism featuring two buckets attached to either end of a lever, along with a pounder. Initially, one of the buckets is filled with water, causing the lever to tip in that direction. An accelerometer integrated into the prototype triggers the bucket filled with water to begin transferring its contents to the empty bucket as the lever continues to oscillate. Sensors within the prototype continually monitor the position of the lever and control the water pump to facilitate its up-and-down motion.

This cyclic process is maintained to ensure a consistent water level differential between the buckets on the lever. Each bucket is equipped with hammers, which, upon being filled with water, are released under the force of gravity, effectively crushing the material beneath them.

The IoT-Based Pounder model, incorporating a lever mechanism and IoT technology, significantly reduces the need for human intervention and operates with minimal energy consumption, making it highly energy-efficient.
